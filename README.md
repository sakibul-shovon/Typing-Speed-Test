Typing Speed Test
A Typing Speed Test application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to test their typing speed by displaying random quotes that they need to type within a selected time limit. The application highlights typed text as correct or incorrect in real-time and calculates the Words Per Minute (WPM) at the end of the test.

Features
Random Quote Generation: Displays a randomly selected quote for each test to keep the experience fresh.
Custom Timer Selection: Users can choose the duration of the typing test from predefined time options.
Real-time Text Highlighting: As the user types, the text is highlighted in green for correct letters and red for incorrect ones, making it easy to track progress.
WPM Calculation: At the end of the test, the app calculates and displays the user's typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM).
Interactive UI: User-friendly interface with a clean design, ensuring a smooth user experience.
How It Works
Select Timer Duration: Choose your preferred test duration from the available options.
Start the Test: Click the "Start Test" button to begin. A random quote will appear, and the timer will start counting down.
Type the Quote: As you type, your input is compared to the displayed quote, with correct letters highlighted in green and incorrect ones in red.
See Your Results: Once the timer runs out or you finish typing the entire quote, the application will calculate your typing speed in WPM and display the result.
